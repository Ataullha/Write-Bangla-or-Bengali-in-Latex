# Write-Bangla-or-Bengali-in-Latex
<p>There is a simple solution to write Bengali/Bangla in Latex using xelatex compiler, 
but many journal/conference/preprint (i.e. arXiv) sites doesnot support xelatex compiler. 
Most of them uses pdflatex compiler. Polyglossia and fontspec package seems not to work with pdflatex.</p>

<p> To write bengali/Bangla in pdflatex, there is a package for typesetting documents in Bangla/Bengali using the Tex/Latex systems,
called <em>[Bangtex](https://www.saha.ac.in/theory/palashbaran.pal/bangtex/bangtex.html)</em>. It is quite difficult 
to write rules based transliterattions manually to appear as Bengali/Bangla in pdflatex. However, there is a perl script that can
automatically transliterate unicode Bengali/Bangla. Once, we get the transliterations, we just need to paste them in the pdflatex!!</p>
