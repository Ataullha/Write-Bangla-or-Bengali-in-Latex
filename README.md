# Write-Bangla-or-Bengali-in-Latex
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a simple solution to write Bengali or Bangla in Latex using xelatex compiler, 
but many journal, conference or preprint (i.e. arXiv) sites doesnot support xelatex compiler. 
Most of them uses pdflatex compiler. Polyglossia and fontspec package seems not to work with pdflatex.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> To write bengali/Bangla in pdflatex, there is a package for typesetting documents in Bangla or Bengali using the Tex/Latex systems,
called <em><a href="https://www.saha.ac.in/theory/palashbaran.pal/bangtex/bangtex.html">[Bangtex]</a></em>. It is quite difficult 
to write rules based transliterattions manually to appear as Bengali or Bangla in pdflatex. However, there is a perl script that can
automatically transliterate unicode Bengali or Bangla. Once, we get the transliterations, we just need to paste them in the pdflatex!!</p>
